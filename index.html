      <h1>Sean's Conneries</h1>
      <p>Hi, my name is Sean. Welcome to my site.</p>
      <p> You might be wondering where the site's name comes from.
        In case you are, here is my brief explanation: first of all,
         <i>connerie</i> is a French word that you could translate 
         as 'nonsense' or even 'bullshit' if 
        you're feeling scandalous. 
        I got the idea from my friend's dad who liked making puns 
        on my name, among which was <i><strong>Sean,</strong> arrÃªte 
        tes <strong>conneries</strong></i> which I'd loosely 
        translate as 'Sean, cut the crap'. It's funny because, 
        well, Sean Connery is a person.
     </p>
      <p>I love a good pun almost as much as I love a shitty anecdote. 
        This website is a host for all the stupid shit I like, from
        personal projects to my favorite books and albums.
